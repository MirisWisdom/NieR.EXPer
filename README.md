        Level Patcher for NieR:Automata
    </p>
</html>

# NieR.EXPer

This tool allows you to set a level of choice in your NieR:Automata profile!

Despite the game's brilliance, its levelling system is flawed in the sense of
making the game too easy when your profile is at a high level. This tool aims
to fix that, by letting you select a lower level and thus bringing back the
challenge.

The process is completely safe and reversible - a backup of your save slot is
made before the patch is applied.

## Instructions

1. Run `YuMi.NieRexper.GUI.exe` after downloading.
2. Click on the save slot you want to modify.
3. Click on the level you want to apply. You can also apply a custom level, too.
4. If all worked, you should see `Status: SUCCESS` in the window!

## Requirements

- the .NET Framework 4.5 is installed (should come by default on Windows 7+);
- you have played NieR:Automata and saved your progress at least once.
