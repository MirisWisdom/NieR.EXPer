        Level Patcher for NieR:Automata

# NieR.EXPer

This tool allows you to set a level of choice in your NieR:Automata profile!

Despite the game's brilliance, its levelling system is flawed in the sense of
making the game too easy when your profile is at a high level. This tool aims
to fix that, by letting you select a lower level and thus bringing back the
challenge.

The process is completely safe and reversible - a backup of your save slot is
made before the patch is applied.

## Instructions

## GUI

0. Note that .NET 4.5 is required to run the executable!
1. Download the executable and run it.
2. Click on the save slot you want to modify.
3. Click on the level you want to apply. You can also apply a custom level, too.
4. If all worked, you should see `Status: SUCCESS` in the window!
